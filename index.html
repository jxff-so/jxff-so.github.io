        <p class="alert alert-dark">
          My name is Jeff and I am currently a Sophomore in SMU studying Information Systems.
          I am currently 22 years old and life is not popping. I usually start my day off by 
          going back to sleep for another hour or so and it really takes me everything in my 
          power to get out of bed.
          <br /><br />
          My hobbies include 
          <u class="anime">watching anime,</u>
          <u class="figurine">collecting figurines</u> 
          and 
          <u class="games">playing games</u>. I
          currently own about three shelves worth of figurines and it is still a growing 
          collection. I also love to go on runs in the middle of the night when I am 
          feeling restless. I play a few games which consists of Genshin Impact, Valorant
          and Project Sekai. 
          <br /><br />
          This module seems fun so I hope to be able to learn a lot of new stuff.
