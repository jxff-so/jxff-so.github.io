    <p>This page serves to give a short introduction about me</p>

    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div>
      <p style="float: left">
        My name is Jeff and I am currently a Sophomore in SMU studying Information Systems. <br />
        I am currently 22 years old and life is not popping. I usually start my day off by <br />
        going back to sleep for another hour or so and it really takes me everything in my <br />
        power to get out of bed.
        <br /><br />
        My hobbies include watching anime, collecting figurines and playing games. I <br />
        currently own about three shelves worth of figurines and it is still a growing <br />
        collection. I also love to go on runs in the middle of the night when I am <br />
        feeling restless. I play a few games which consists of Genshin Impact, Valorant <br />
        and Project Sekai. 
        <br /><br />
        This module seems fun so I hope to be able to learn a lot of new stuff.
